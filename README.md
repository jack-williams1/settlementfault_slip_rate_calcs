# settlementfault_slip_rate_calcs

Finalised codes for displacement-time analysis for estimating the Settlement Fault's slip rate following acceptance of associated manuscript (Williams et al accepted), and inclusion of supplementary material S1-S3. Files are:

-slip_rate_evolution.m: creates displacement and time path histories for the Settlement Fault. Stores in MATLAB variable 'slip_rate_results.'

-slip_rate_evolution_plots.m: uses stairs function in MATLAB to plot time-displacement histories stored in variable 'slip_rate_results . Use to reproduce Figures 12 and S7 in Williams et al. (accepted).

-orb_cm_intep.m: MATLAB variable for plotting heatmap in slip_rate_evolution_plots.m

-Inclusion of supplements S1-S3 in file: SettlementFaultSupplementaryFiles.pdf. File includes: [Supplement S1] Figures S1-S8, [Supplement S2] Laboratory report for the Owaka Trench radiocarbon dating samples, and [Supplement S3] Laboratory report for the Owaka trench OSL samples.
